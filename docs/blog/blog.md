Yesterday, when I fell asleep, it was with the clear memory of smiles shining on the faces of our kids. After several months of hard work, they did it. They **won the Junior Achievement Young Entreprise** regional contest organized in Bordeaux and were qualified for the National contest!

Fable 1.0 beta has been out in the wild for several weeks now and the community has already provided very valuable feedback. Some people are concerned about the mix of .NET and JS tools and it's true there were some friction points we had to fix. The main one concerned Fable libraries: by nature they belong to the .NET ecosystem, but their destiny is to be converted to JS.

Fable has recently added support for a subset of the FSharp.Reflection namespace. Which is really great, allowing us to inspect type information at run-time in the browser. Today, we will be exploring an application of meta-programming using FSharp.Reflection to abstract a very common task in web development: client-server communication.

## [Implementing Pong in a functional manner with Fable](http://oopbase.de/implementing-pong-in-a-functional-manner-with-fable/)

> By [Marcel Schwark](https://twitter.com/oopbase) on Dec 26, 2016

For the last few weeks I’ve been playing around with Fable. As a F# enthusiast who had to deal with a lot of JavaScript code during his studies, I was quite curious what Fable was all about. [...]
Being motivated by Super Fable Mario, I thought creating a simple game myself might be a good way to start with Fable. As you can read by the title, I chose Pong as my starting project. So without further ado, let’s start with the actual game.

## [From Elm to Fable](http://lucasmreis.github.io/blog/from-elm-to-fable/)

> By [Lucas Reis](https://twitter.com/iamlucasmreis) on Dec 9, 2016

A few months ago I started a quest to gain reliability in frontend development. I chose Elm as my starting point. [...]
It turns out that there is an F# to JS compiler called Fable. [...] In this post I'll "convert" the star wars app I wrote in Elm to Fable, and then I'll refactor it.
Along the way, I'll compare the experience to both Elm and regular Javascript workflows.

## [Tree Shaking with Fable](blog/Tree-shaking.html)

Hi everybody! This is my first contribution to the [F# advent calendar](https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2016/) and you'll probably be very surprised to know it will be about... Fable! Yes, the lightweight F# compiler that emits JavaScript you can be proud of (or at least I'll be). This time I want to talk you about one of the exciting new features introduced in [Fable 0.7](blog/Introducing-0-7.html): tree shaking.

## [Introducing 0.7](blog/Introducing-0-7.html)

So finally here it is! It took a bit longer than expected but I'm very happy to announce Fable 0.7 has been released to npm. This version includes lots of improvements thanks to feedback from the community, it's almost a full rewrite and could be considered 1.0 (in fact, 1.0 will probably be this with minor upgrades).
